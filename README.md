## About Us
ACM-W supports, celebrates, and advocates internationally for the full engagement of women in all aspects of computer science. The Manipal chapter of ACM-W wishes to carry forward the vision of ACM-W in establishing a society that not only motivates young girls to become zealous programmers but also provides them with adequate resources and the right mentorship at every step in their path.

### What We Do
>Empowered women empower women

Resources, connections and mentorship play a pivotal role in proliferating women participation in technology. Being a student-centric chapter, we focus on the needs of girls who are striving to build a career in technology. Our events are primarily research-centric and collaborative with the various computer-related departments at college. Each of us believes in contributing to a cause that is greater than ourselves.
